<!-- **Bank of Anthos** is a sample HTTP-based web app that simulates a bank's payment processing network, allowing users to create artificial bank accounts and complete transactions.

**HCB Finance** is an HTTP-based web app that records and displays bank payment transactions to registered users.  There is no communication between banks and HCB -- this app is a ledger resource for HCB customers and employees.

This application is based on the Google sample application **Bank of Anthos**.  Review the original code on [GitHub](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/bank-of-anthos).

## Get Started on GKE

1. Ensure you have the following requirements:
   - [Google Cloud project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#creating_a_project).
   - Shell environment with `gcloud`, `git`, and `kubectl`.

2. Clone the repository.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/bank-of-anthos
   cd bank-of-anthos/
   ```

3. Set the Google Cloud project and region and ensure the Google Kubernetes Engine API is enabled.

   ```sh
   export PROJECT_ID=<PROJECT_ID>
   export REGION=us-central1
   gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com \
     --project=${PROJECT_ID}
   ```

   Substitute `<PROJECT_ID>` with the ID of your Google Cloud project.

4. Create a GKE cluster and get the credentials for it.

   ```sh
   gcloud container clusters create-auto bank-of-anthos \
     --project=${PROJECT_ID} --region=${REGION}
   ```

   Creating the cluster may take a few minutes.

5. Deploy Bank of Anthos to the cluster.

   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f ./extras/jwt/jwt-secret.yaml
   kubectl apply -f ./kubernetes-manifests
   ```

6. Wait for the pods to be ready.

   ```sh
   kubectl get pods
   ```

   After a few minutes, you should see the Pods in a `Running` state:

   ```
   NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   accounts-db-6f589464bc-6r7b7          1/1     Running   0          99s
   balancereader-797bf6d7c5-8xvp6        1/1     Running   0          99s
   contacts-769c4fb556-25pg2             1/1     Running   0          98s
   frontend-7c96b54f6b-zkdbz             1/1     Running   0          98s
   ledger-db-5b78474d4f-p6xcb            1/1     Running   0          98s
   ledgerwriter-84bf44b95d-65mqf         1/1     Running   0          97s
   loadgenerator-559667b6ff-4zsvb        1/1     Running   0          97s
   transactionhistory-5569754896-z94cn   1/1     Running   0          97s
   userservice-78dc876bff-pdhtl          1/1     Running   0          96s
   ```

7. Access the web frontend in a browser using the frontend's external IP.

   ```sh
   kubectl get service frontend | awk '{print $4}'
   ```

   Visit `http://EXTERNAL_IP` in a web browser to access your instance of Bank of Anthos.

8. Once you are done with it, delete the GKE cluster.

   ```sh
   gcloud container clusters delete bank-of-anthos \
     --project=${PROJECT_ID} --region=${REGION}
   ```

   Deleting the cluster may take a few minutes.

## Additional deployment options

- **Workload Identity**: [See these instructions.](/docs/workload-identity.md)
- **Cloud SQL**: [See these instructions](/extras/cloudsql) to replace the in-cluster databases with hosted Google Cloud SQL.
- **Multi Cluster with Cloud SQL**: [See these instructions](/extras/cloudsql-multicluster) to replicate the app across two regions using GKE, Multi Cluster Ingress, and Google Cloud SQL.
- **Istio**: [See these instructions](/extras/istio) to configure an IngressGateway.
- **Anthos Service Mesh**: ASM requires Workload Identity to be enabled in your GKE cluster. [See the workload identity instructions](/docs/workload-identity.md) to configure and deploy the app. Then, apply `extras/istio/` to your cluster to configure frontend ingress.
- **Java Monolith (VM)**: We provide a version of this app where the three Java microservices are coupled together into one monolithic service, which you can deploy inside a VM (eg. Google Compute Engine). See the [ledgermonolith](/src/ledgermonolith) directory.
